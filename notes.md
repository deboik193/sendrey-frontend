When you define "auth/verify-phone", Redux Toolkit automatically generates three action types:

// Generated action types:
- auth/verify-phone/pending    // When the request starts
- auth/verify-phone/fulfilled  // When the request succeeds  
- auth/verify-phone/rejected   // When the request fails

it uses it to know the action being performed
